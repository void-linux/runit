.TH sv 8
.SH NAME
sv \- control and manage services monitored by
.BR runsv (8)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sv
[\-v] [\-w
.I sec\fR]
.I command
.I services
.P
.BI /etc/init.d/ service
[\-w
.I sec\fR]
.I command
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B sv
program reports the current status and controls the state of services
monitored by the
.BR runsv (8)
supervisor.
.P
.I services
consists of one or more arguments, each argument naming a directory
.I service
used by
.BR runsv (8).
If
.I service
doesn't start with a dot or slash and doesn't end with a slash, it is
searched in the default services directory
.IR /var/service/ ,
otherwise relative to the current directory.
.P
.I command
is one of up, down, status, once, pause, cont, hup, alarm, interrupt, 1, 2,
term, kill, or exit, or start, stop, restart, shutdown, force-stop,
force-reload, force-restart, force-shutdown.
.P
The
.B sv
program can be sym-linked to
.I /etc/init.d/
to provide an LSB init script interface.
The
.I service
to be controlled then is specified by the base name of the ``init script''.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B status
Report the current status of the service, and the appendant log service if
available, to standard output.
.TP
.B up
If the service is not running, start it.
If the service stops, restart it.
.TP
.B down
If the service is running, send it the TERM signal, and the CONT signal.
If ./run exits, start ./finish if it exists.
After it stops, do not restart service.
.TP
.B once
If the service is not running, start it.
Do not restart it if it stops.
.TP
.B pause cont hup alarm interrupt quit 1 2 term kill
If the service is running, send it the STOP, CONT, HUP, ALRM, INT, QUIT,
USR1, USR2, TERM, or KILL signal respectively.
.TP
.B exit
If the service is running, send it the TERM signal, and the CONT signal.
Do not restart the service.
If the service is down, and no log service exists,
.BR runsv (8)
exits.
If the service is down and a log service exists,
.BR runsv (8)
closes the standard input of the log service and waits for it to terminate.
If the log service is down,
.BR runsv (8)
exits.
This command is ignored if it is given to an appendant log service.
.P
.BR sv
actually looks only at the first character of these
.IR command s.
.SS Commands compatible to LSB init script actions
.TP
.B status
Same as
.IR status .
.TP
.B start
Same as
.IR up ,
but wait up to 7 seconds for the command to take effect.
Then report the status or timeout.
If the script
.I ./check
exists in the service directory,
.B sv
runs this script to check whether the service is up and available;
it's considered to be available if
.I ./check
exits with 0.
.TP
.B stop
Same as
.IR down ,
but wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become down.
Then report the status or timeout.
.TP
.B reload
Same as
.IR hup ,
and additionally report the status afterwards.
.TP
.B restart
Send the commands
.IR term ,
.IR cont ,
and
.I up
to the service, and wait up to 7 seconds for the service to restart.
Then report the status or timeout.
If the script
.I ./check
exists in the service directory,
.B sv
runs this script to check whether the service is up and available again;
it's considered to be available if
.I ./check
exits with 0.
.TP
.B shutdown
Same as
.IR exit ,
but wait up to 7 seconds for the
.BR runsv (8)
process to terminate.
Then report the status or timeout.
.TP
.B force-stop
Same as
.IR down ,
but wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become down.
Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the
.I kill
command.
.TP
.B force-reload
Send the service the
.I term
and
.I cont
commands, and wait up to 7 seconds for the service to restart.
Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the
.I kill
command.
.TP
.B force-restart
Send the service the
.IR term ,
.I cont
and
.I up
commands, and wait up to 7 seconds for the service to restart.
Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the
.I kill
command.
If the script
.I ./check
exists in the service directory,
.B sv
runs this script to check whether the service is up and available again;
it's considered to be available if
.I ./check
exits with 0.
.TP
.B force-shutdown
Same as
.IR exit ,
but wait up to 7 seconds for the
.BR runsv (8)
process to terminate.
Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the
.I kill
command.
.TP
.B try-restart
if the service is running, send it the
.I term
and
.I cont
commands, and wait up to 7 seconds for the service to restart.
Then report the status or timeout.

.SS Additional Commands
.TP
.B check
Check for the service to be in the state that's been requested.
Wait up to 7 seconds for the service to reach the requested state, then
report the status or timeout.
If the requested state of the service is
.IR up ,
and the script
.I ./check
exists in the service directory,
.B sv
runs this script to check whether the service is up and running; it's
considered to be up if
.I ./check
exits with 0.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
If the
.I command
is up, down, term, once, cont, or exit, then wait up to 7 seconds for the
command to take effect.
Then report the status or timeout.
.TP
.B \-w \fIsec
Override the default timeout of 7 seconds with
.I sec
seconds.
This option implies
.IR \-v .
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SVDIR
The environment variable $SVDIR overrides the default services directory
.IR /var/service/ .
.TP
.B SVWAIT
The environment variable $SVWAIT overrides the default 7 seconds to wait
for a command to take effect.
It is overridden by the \-w option.
.SH EXIT CODES
.B sv
exits 0, if the
.I command
was successfully sent to all
.IR services ,
and, if it was told to wait, the
.I command
has taken effect to all services.
.P
For each
.I service
that caused an error (e.g. the directory is not controlled by a
.BR runsv (8)
process, or
.B sv
timed out while waiting),
.B sv
increases the exit code by one and exits non zero.
The maximum is 99.
.B sv
exits 100 on error.
.P
If
.B sv
is called with a base name other than
.BR sv :
it exits 1 on timeout or trouble sending the command; if the
.I command
is
.BR status ,
it exits 3 if the service is down, and 4 if the status is unknown;
it exits 2 on wrong usage, and 151 on error.
