.TH runit 8
.SH NAME
runit \- a UNIX process no 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B runit
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B runit
must be run as Unix process no 1. It performs the system's
booting, running, and shutdown in three Stages:
.SH STAGE 1
.B runit
runs
.I /etc/runit/1
and waits for it to terminate. The system's one time tasks are done here.
.I /etc/runit/1
has full control of
.I /dev/console
to be able to start an emergency shell if the one time initialization tasks
fail. If
.I /etc/runit/1
itself crashes,
.B runit
will skip stage 2 and enter stage 3.
.SH STAGE 2
.B runit
runs
.IR /etc/runit/2 ,
which should not return until system shutdown; if it crashes, it will be
restarted. Normally
.I /etc/runit/2
starts
.BR runsvdir (8).
.B runit
is able to handle the ctrl-alt-del keyboard request in Stage 2, see below.
.SH STAGE 3
If
.B runit
is told to shutdown the system, or the Stage 2 returns without errors, it
terminates Stage 2 if it is running, and runs
.IR /etc/runit/3 .
The systems tasks to shutdown and halt or reboot are done here.
Normally in Stage 3
.I /etc/runit/3
checks for the file
.IR /etc/runit/reboot .
If it exists, the system is rebooted, it is halted otherwise.
.SH CTRL-ALT-DEL
If
.B runit
receives the ctrl-alt-del keyboard request and the file
.I /etc/runit/ctrlaltdel
exists,
.B runit
runs
.IR /etc/runit/ctrlaltdel ,
waits for it to terminate and then sends itself a CONT signal.
.SH SIGNALS
.B runit
only accepts signals in Stage 2.
.P
If
.B runit
receives a CONT signal and the file
.I /etc/runit/stopit
exists,
.B runit
is told to shutdown the system.
.P
if
.B runit
receives an INT signal, a ctrl-alt-del keyboard request is triggered.
